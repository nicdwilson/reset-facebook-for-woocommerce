## Delete product data

This will run a version of the [snippet found here](https://woocommerce.com/document/facebook-for-woocommerce-delete-or-reset-all-facebook-products/) in the Facebook for WooCommerce documentation, designed to remove all content from your catalog.

## Remove orphans

At times data in your WooCommerce catalogue and your Facebook catalogue can get out of synch. This causes you to have items in your Facebook catalogue that refuse to delete, because "they were created by WooCommerce". If you find that you cannot delete them using the normal deletion functions in WooCommerce, this function allows you to manually enter their content ID and remove the item from the Facebook catalog.

## Test products

This allows you to validate a product by entering the product ID. The basic validation will run against the product and return any possible problems with that product. Currently you can only validate a single product at a time.
